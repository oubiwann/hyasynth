Dependencies
------------

Hyasynth requires `SuperCollider`_ to be installed (and for now, running). You
can download the appropriate binary for your system at the
`SuperCollider downloads page`_:

The rest of the dependencies will be automatically installed by the ``make``
targets. The ``make`` target that installs the deps can, of course, be called
directly:

.. code:: bash

    $ make deps


Getting Started
---------------

To get Hyasynth up and running quickly, simply do this:

.. code:: bash

  $ make start

You will be greeted with a banner like the following:

.. code:: text
